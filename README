INTRODUCTION

Collocations-Benchmark is the GitHub repository for the blog post
http://blog.mpacula.com/2011/12/18/counting-collocations-ghc-and-g-benchmarked.

Collocations-Benchmark provides Haskell and C++ sources of a
collocation counter: an algorithm that counts which words go close
together in a natural language corpus.


COMPILING

To compile the benchmark binaries, simply call 'make'. To compile
profiling binaries, call 'make prof'. Plots can be generated using
'make all-plots'.


RUNNING

To run the benchmark, run the 'run-benchmark.sh' script without any
arguments. The results will be written to the files in the 'data'
directory.

If you wish to run the binaries directly, use pipes/redirection for
input and output. For example: 

cat data/input.txt | ./colocations-cpp > output.txt
